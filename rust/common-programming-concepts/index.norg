* Prolog
  This are notes that i take while watching You Tube video call {https://youtu.be/BpPEoZW5IiY?si=I_b-zmcVxAhzAPQh}[Learn Rust Programming - Complete Course ðŸ¦€]. This course is brought by {https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ne_iOUtUPtKiBasvWgz_g}[Arfan Zubi]. These are the reason why learning Rust:
  - Blazingly fast
  - Rich type system
  - no garbage collector
  - usefull compiler output
  - memory safety
  - most beloved programming language

  Several resources for learning Rust:
  - {https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/}[The Book]
  - {https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings}[Rustlings]
  - {https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/}[Rust by Example]
  - {https://practice.rs/why-exercise.html}[Rust by Practice]

  Example code
  @code rust
  fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
  }
  @end
  Explanations:
  /main/ function in the entry point of the code, we declare function with the /fn/ keyword. /println/ is a macro and all macro will be ended with explanation mark.
